  <h2>- Interest in IT -</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Among all the subjects in RMIT, what makes me choose bachelor of IT?
    I’ve started to play video games when I was a kid, affected by my brother.
     Designing my own game was my dream since then. To get to know how games are
      created, I searched online and that’s my first time to know IT.</p>
  <p>For me, what attracts me most in RMIT is that this university focuses on
     practical rather than just theoretical. I believe only practice makes me
     progress most.</p>
  <p>I want to learn as many programming languages as many possible so no matter
     what my future job requires, I can handle it.</p>

    <h2>- Project Ideas -</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>For me, IT means make the world better and benefit the people using
       existing technology. I want to develop a smartphone app called Parker,
        which aims to help people in Australia find parking lot with available
         parking space when they are driving out.</p>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>There are approximately 20.14 million motor vehicles in Australia as of
       January 2021, and the population is 26.02 million. Around 77.4% of
       Australian may choose to drive out during weekends of holidays. People
       who own cars face a problem every time they go out – where to park my car?
        I’ve hung out with my family in a weekend when we first came to Melbourne.
        It took us 20 minutes circling around the parking lot outside the shopping
        mall to find a parking space. We realised that the parking lot was full
        eventually, so we can only drive out and find another parking lot. I
        wondered at that time, what if there is an app that can help people find
         empty parking spaces so that people won’t waste time on it. Since then,
         an idea gradually came to my mind.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Let’s moving on to the functions of Parker. The main function of Parker is,
       without doubt, helping people find empty parking space when driving out.
       Therefore, Parker contains a map and a search bar in the home page. Once
       the user types the destination into the search bar, nearby parking lots
        will be shown in the map. Each parking lot has a colour bar next to it.
        Red means it’s full or over 80% parking spaces are taken, orange means
         only 40% parking spaces left in the parking lot, yellow means the rest
          parking spaces are around 50%, and green means there are still a lot
           parking spaces in this parking lot. It gives the user an intuitive
           overview of the parking lots nearby.</p>
      <p>Users can see details of the parking lot by clicking it such as opening
        time, fees, contact method and so on. After choosing which one to go,
         Parker will start the direction. However, Parker won’t directly lead
         the user to the exact parking space in the parking lot, instead, Parker
         will show the recommended floor of the parking lot to go, which has most
          empty parking spaces.</p>
      <p>Nowadays, people's environmental awareness is getting stronger and
        stronger, more and more people choose to buy an electric car instead of
        traditional car burns petrol. Therefore, users of parker can set a filter
         to only see parking lots with charging pile. Also, the filter can do more
         than just search for charging piles, users can set the filter to find
          which parking lots meet the requirements they need.</p>
      <p>The classic theme of Parker is adapted to the user’s phone theme. But
        the user can change the app’s theme anytime in settings. Besides some
        basic reset themes, users can customise the app interface as they like
        freely. When the users open Parker for the first time, there will be a
        guidance teaching people to use this app. Users can review the guidance
        anytime if they forget how to use the app.</p>
      <p>If the users meet problems or bugs while using Parker, they can contact
        us and describe the bugs or problems through the “Report” button. Me and
        my partners (if I have) will look through the feedbacks and solve the
         problems to make users’ experience better while using Parker. </p>
      <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
      <p>To use this app, users just need a phone that can connect to network and
         that’s all. This app will be published both on iOS and Android app store.
          There is no need to worry about don’t know how to use this app. The
          guidance will be very detailed to make sure the elders also know how to use it. </p>
      <h3>Skills Required</h3>
      <p>I will use MIT app inventor to develop this app. To respond to users’
        feedback, I also need knowledge of User Centre Designed and User experience
        (UX) to make users’ experience better. I may need to learn how to user MIT
        app inventor from now on to make sure I can develop Parker.</p>
      <h3>Outcome</h3>
      <p>If my project is successful, people those who use Parker’s life will be
         more convenient. They can easily find suitable parking lots that meet their
          requirements, no need to waste time in tossing among parking lots. This
           will solve problems of finding empty parking spaces when driving out.
            I would be very proud of Parker if it does succeed in the future.</p>
